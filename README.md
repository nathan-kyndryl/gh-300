# GH-300 GitHub Copilot: Pass The Exam, Deeply Understand Copilot

With around **750 exam-style questions** paired with **high-impact explanations**, this repository is designed to help you pass the **Microsoft GitHub Copilot certification (GH-300)** exam with a clear, structured learning path.

It teaches GitHub Copilot from the ground up, starting with fundamentals that stay true across real developer workflows. You will build a solid foundation in core concepts like prompting, context, suggestions, chat, plans, governance, privacy boundaries, and Responsible AI.

After the fundamentals are clear, each concept is connected to GitHub Copilot features, product behavior, and exam-relevant distinctions. This approach helps you study for the exam without relying on memorization, because you understand what Copilot is doing, how it fits the workflow, and why it behaves that way.

- Engineers who want to understand prompting, context, chat, suggestions, plans, governance, and safe usage in a practical way
- Readers who want to understand both the **“why”** and the **“how”** of GitHub Copilot, not just memorize features
- **Deep-knowledge learners** who want strong fundamentals first, then mapping to real Copilot features and exam scenarios

## Community Discussion & Study Group

This GitHub Discussions started as part of an active **study group and discussions in 2025**, before the repository was made public. During that phase, a large number of real discussions, clarifications, and deep concept breakdowns were shared and refined.

The discussions remain a **high-value source of insights**, covering tricky scenarios, common misunderstandings, and real exam thinking patterns.

You can explore and see all the discussions here:

## Why use this repo for study/revision?
This repo doesn’t replace **official GitHub documentation** or **Microsoft Learn**. It **compresses** them into **high signal** study material and practice tests that focus on the concepts, distinctions, and patterns that matter most.

If you feel **overwhelmed by the volume of product details**, feature variations, policy differences, and prompt-related guidance, this repo is built to reduce noise without losing what matters. The goal is to shorten the path to **exam-ready, deep understanding** by focusing on the key knowledge you need to interpret GitHub Copilot correctly under exam pressure.

Use **official docs** when you want the **full depth, latest wording, and original context**. Use this repo when you want to **learn faster**, **revise more effectively**, and still understand the **“why”** behind Copilot features, behaviors, and safe usage decisions.

## How to use this repo
-  Start with the knowledge documents in order. Each document builds on the previous one.
-  Read for understanding first, then revisit documents when you want a fast, high-signal refresher.
-  Use the Raw practice tests as a diagnostic to identify weak areas and confusion points.
-  When you miss a question, use the Detailed version to repair the underlying concept.
-  Revisit the knowledge documents after practice so the ideas become clearer and easier to retain.
-  As you revise, aim to explain concepts in your own words instead of memorizing wording.

## Practice Exam Simulator

To run the simulator locally with a small built-in HTTP server instead of GitHub Pages:

- macOS/Linux: `./scripts/start-exam.sh`
- Windows PowerShell: `.\scripts\start-exam.ps1`

Both scripts default to port `8000` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/`. You can pass a different port if needed.

### Exam creator and history workflow

- Build custom practice exams by setting question count, timer (including no limit), scaled passing score, and an `Avoid repeats from last N completed exams` window.
- Preview the weighted domain mix before starting an exam.
- Resume or discard an in-progress exam at any time.
- Submit exams, review summary entries in exam history, and filter the current exam's post-exam results.
- The simulator de-duplicates the question pool, samples questions using weighted domains, avoids recent repeats when possible, and falls back to the full unique pool when needed.
